# Spatialist_ReachAnalysis
To analyze metric reach, directional reach, intersection reach, and more.

There is another version of this software which can be run in Rhino 5 (32-bit) as a series of Grasshopper definitions. The toolkit can be downloaded from
https://www.food4rhino.com/resource/grasshopper-reach-analysis-toolkit

The theoretical foundation of the reach analysis can be found in
Peponis, J., Bafna, S., & Zhang, Z. (2008). The connectivity of streets: reach and directional distance. *Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design, 35*(5), 881–901.

The algorithms and implementation details can be found in the following two publications:

Feng, C., & Zhang, W. (Forthcoming). Algorithms for the parametric analysis of metric, directional, and intersection reach. *Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science*.
